            <p>Throughout the past two years I have learnt so much to become the ICT Specialist that I am today, of course it was not difficult for me to learn and adjust as I entered every classroom with an open-mind, I listened to every mentor with an open-mind too and that made things easier for me. Every time I went for my WIL experience I had my own goals and I really tried hard to achieve all of them I will not lie there has been some good and some bad but it was bound to happen as if there was no bad then I would not have learnt anything and also expecting perfection would be silly of me.</p>
            <p>Throughout the past two years I will say that I have learnt to keep a journal whereby I wrote down my experiences of being a student and also a student teacher. This gave me an opportunity the opportunity to reflect on the experiences and see the good and the bad and how I could change and grow as a person by doing better, it also gave me an opportunity to reflect on my successes. Keeping a journal helped me create order when my world felt like it's in chaos. I get to know myself by revealing my most private fears, thoughts, and feelings. I looked at my writing time as personal relaxation time. It's a time when I could de-stress and wind down.</p>
            <p>When It comes to my goals, I made sure that I wrote them down and tried to tick them one by one. Setting goals helps trigger new behaviors, helps guides your focus and helps you sustain that momentum in life. Goals also help align your focus and promote a sense of self-mastery. In the end, you can't manage what you don't measure and you can't improve upon something that you don't properly manage. In most of my goals I did well and then in some of the goals I realized that there are areas I should work on.</p>
            <p>I’d be lying if I said that I never went home and just wanted to cry after a tough day of student teaching. However, on those harder days, I pushed myself to put on a smile and find ways to help even the unruliest students. As I reflected back on the experience, those days tried me as a teacher, pushed me to improve, and helped me realize that the successes were all the more worth it in the end.</p>
            <p>Throughout the past two years I’ve come to learn that as teachers we do not have the same teaching persona and that is alright because as people we are different and as long the manner in which one presents themselves to the learner’s works for them then that is alright. The manner in which we present ourselves as teachers, our personal beliefs, and our professional beliefs will not be the same and it is also okay to pick something positive from the other person’s persona.</p>
            <p>The manner in which I used to teach the content before has improved so much, and I believe that it will continue to improve.</p>
            <p>Throughout the year I have come to realised that my teaching philosophy changes from time to time. From when I was a first year student, to when I started doing my practical’s and over the years of being an education student and participating in the work integrated learning which was required in order for me to learn and also in order for me to obtain my degree.</p>
            <p>There is a lot of experiences I have been through as a student and also as an instructor. Some are different and some are similar, but most of all what I have realised is that those experiences change my thoughts about teaching and learning from time to time.</p>
            <p>What has been going well throughout the years of being a student and also figuring out my teaching philosophy is that I know what I always try to achieve in my learners with my teaching. The focus is always on making sure that my teaching is not only information that is passed on but lifelong information that can be used even outside of school, also being open minded to learning new knowledge from learners without being biased. This for me is very important.</p>
            <p>What I could improve on as an ICT specialist in my teaching philosophy is the manner in which I deliver my lessons for effective teaching and learning by not focusing only on delivering the lesson and not making the lesson less learner based. This is because I believe that it is best to allow your learners to learn by themselves and to also learn from their different ideas from them rather than always feeding the learners with knowledge most of the time. That tends to cause the engagement during lessons and throughout the year to be low.</p>
            <p>As an ICT specialist the beliefs that would best describe me would be that I am open-minded to learning new things, I care about my learners, what is important to me is that my learners learn in accordance to their learning abilities, I do not compromise the teaching and learning process to fit my personal gains, I do my best to make sure that teaching and learning is successful, I listen to my learners needs, I try all my best to make sure that the learning environment is a friendly environment for all learners and I am all that a good ICT specialist is and more.</p>
            <p>How I know that I think about my learning is the manner in which I collect new information or knowledge from the learners each time there is something new from lessons, I actually reflect on it and write it down or just have it programmed in my mind by putting more thought and reasoning to it to change the previous belief. Thereafter I am able to apply that to my teaching philosophy as an ICT specialist. How the potential impact of my learning has impacted my work as an ICT specialist is by growing and improving my teaching philosophy from time to time. This makes me look forward to learning, growing and improving more as a teacher.</p>
