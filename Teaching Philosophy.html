            <p>My philosophy of education is that all learners are unique and must have a stimulating educational environment where they can grow physically, mentally, emotionally and socially. It is my desire to create this type of atmosphere (whereby there is also kindness, care, inclusivity, fairness, positivity, enthusiasm, organization, open-mindedness, focus, empathy, freedom and patience) where learners can meet their full potential. I will provide learners with a safe environment.</p>
            <p>I believe that there are five essential elements that are conductive to learning, and those elements are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>- The teacher role is to act as a guide.</li>
                <li>- Students must have access to hands-on activities.</li>
                <li>- Students should be able to have choices and let their curiosity direct their learning.</li>
                <li>- Students need the opportunity to practice skills in a safe environment.</li>
                <li>- Technology must be incorporated into the school day.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because all classroom and learners are unique and have specific learning needs and styles. As a teacher it is my duty to ensure that I append time helping each learner achieve their highest potential. I believe that all children are unique and have something special that they can bring to their own education. I will assist my learners to express themselves and accept themselves for who they are, as well as embrace the differences of others.</p>
            <p>Every classroom has its own unique community and my role as a teacher will be to assist each child in developing their own potential and learning styles. I will present the curriculum that will incorporate each different learning style, as well as make the content relevant to learner’s lives. I believe it is my duty to incorporate hands-on learning, co-operative learning, projects, themes and individual work that engage and activate learners learning.</p>
            <p>The moral objective of teaching, for me, is that as a teacher I am morally obligated to enter the classroom with one of the learners. Thus, I will maximize the positive benefits that naturally come along with any self-fulfilling prophecy with dedication, perseverance and hard work my learners will rise to the occasion. I aim to bring an open-minded, high expectations and a positive attitude to the classroom each day. I believe that I owe it to every learner, as well as the community to bring consistency, diligence and warmth to my job in the hope that I can ultimately inspire and encourage such traits in their children as well.</p>
            <p>I believe that a classroom should be safe, caring community where children are free to speak their mind and blossom and grow. I will use strategies to ensure that all classroom communities flourish, with the morning meetings, positive and negative discipline, classroom jobs and problem solving skills. Like the saying goes “It takes a village” to foster truly community based learning.</p>
            <p>Teaching is a process of learning from your learners, colleagues, parents, and the community. This is a lifelong process where you learn new strategies, new ideas and new philosophies and in my four years of being a student t teacher I have learnt that overtime my teaching philosophy may change and I am up for the learning or challenge as it will help me grow in this profession.</p>
