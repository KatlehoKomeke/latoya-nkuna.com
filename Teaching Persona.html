            <p>I am a teacher who plans on making a difference in every learners (that will come my direction, whether I will be teaching them or not) life. The impact that I believe I am capable of making in the learners lives is not of for classroom purposes but also their long-term success. I believe and I know that I am patient, kind, caring, approachable, inclusive, fair, open-minded, enthusiastic, positive, organized and focused.  I believe that I am a strong communicator, a good listener, a person who can show empathy towards other people, a person who values real-world learning and a life-long learner. Who I am as a teacher is the person I present to every learner and also towards my colleagues.</p>
            <p>My personal values and beliefs as a teacher consists of a couple of values which include having dignity, truthfulness, fairness, responsibility and freedom. As a human being I believe that most human beings if not all want to learn and that learning is essential innate, ingoing and lifelong process. The process of teaching and learning is a process of making meaning of the world and all learners are unique and responsible for their own learning. I believe that as a teacher I should create a positive environment for learners which will give more opportunities to learn. I should also be able to motivate the learners not only as their teacher but also as their parent and someone who understand them, come up with creative teaching strategies to help build learners confidence, reflect on every lesson and evaluate to maintain high teaching standards and come up with achievable tasks which will be suitable to every learners learning capabilities.</p>
            <p>Respect is very important when you are a teacher therefore I believe that the respect I provide my learners with is the same respect I will receive. Yes, it will not always be reciprocated but it is very important that both parties know that if that will not be the case then there will be serious consequences for the action that might have gone against this.  Believe that as a professional teacher, one should be a strong communicator, a good listener who is focused on collaboration, adaptable, engaging, have characteristics of effective teaching. A teacher is not only the dispenser of knowledge but a facilitator and coordinator in the classroom environment. I believe that it is my duty to communicate knowledge in a clear and structured way, to explain correct solutions, to give learners clear and resolvable problems and to ensure calm and concentration in the classroom.</p>
